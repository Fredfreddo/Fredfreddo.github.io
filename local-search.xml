    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Books-I-read-in-2023"><a href="#Books-I-read-in-2023" class="headerlink" title="Books I read in 2023"></a>Books I read in 2023</h1><p>Luckily I had time to read some this year. There are about 3 categories: Detective Novels that I read for fun and leisure; books about Revolution; and other literatures.</p><h2 id="Mysteries-and-Detective-Novels"><a href="#Mysteries-and-Detective-Novels" class="headerlink" title="Mysteries and Detective Novels:"></a>Mysteries and Detective Novels:</h2><p>I wish that I will always have an unread <strong>Agatha Christie</strong> book on the shelf, because it would be the best way to pass a sunny afternoon. One may just enjoy reading on the sofa with sunshine pouring on the papers, and one never has to bother remembering any details afterwards.</p><p>This year, three of her masterpieces were appreciated.</p><ul><li><p>   <strong><em>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</em></strong>. The very first story of <strong>Poirot</strong>. Never a fan of <em>poisons</em>, I have to admit.</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>A Murder is Announced</em></strong>. The first <strong>Miss Marple</strong> book I read. Not quite impressive. Only things I recall is the nicknames of the sisters and a cat named <em>Tiglath-Pileser</em>, which was the Assyrian King whose name my high school history teacher claimed to be the most difficult to memorize. </p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>Evil Under the Sun</em></strong>. A signature demonstration of Agatha’s <em>feminism</em>. A woman romantically involved with more than one man is often judged harshly and receives unjust speculation, yet for most of the times she herself would be the vulnerable victim in the end.</p></li></ul><p>There is also <strong><em>The Day of the Jackal</em></strong>. I bought the book in 2019 simply because it is on a top list of detective novels of all time. Having observed how people reacted to <strong>Shinzo Abe</strong>’s death and reading <strong>Boris Savinkov</strong>’s biography, I developed an interest into assassination stories. Is <em>political assassination</em> against single target without casualty on civilians in a non-democratic country justifiable? I wonder how similar C is to the countries like R and F 50-100 years ago, and if similar incident may happen. </p><h2 id="Revolution"><a href="#Revolution" class="headerlink" title="Revolution:"></a>Revolution:</h2><p>I somehow believe that it is imminent and I should at least theoretically and emotionally be prepared. I fancy stories from late 19th century to early 20th century, when a whole spectrum of revolutionary ideologies was being put into experiment and actions repeatedly.</p><ul><li><p>   <strong><em>Every Man a King</em></strong>. The autobiography of <strong>Huey Long</strong>. I wrote about him <a href="%5Blink%5D(https://fredfreddo.github.io/2023/12/26/1227/)">here</a>. Imagine if he had lived on and run against <strong>FDR</strong>, what would have happened?</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>Rebel Girl</em></strong>. An Autobiography of <strong>Elizabeth Gurley Flynn</strong>, an Irish American social activist. The book focused on her childhood and how she worked with <em>International Workers of the World</em> (IWW), delivered speech to crowds since middle school, and organized countless strikes that profoundly promoted workers rights in the U.S. There was one paragraph of her seeing people in Chinese restaurant celebrating in <em>1912</em>. I have imagined that kind of scene happening to me many times before. Myself in 2020 was expecting to celebrate <em>Unification</em> before my Leuven exchange ended, but now I am convinced that there is something more important. </p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>Rosa Luxemburg</em></strong>. A biography written by <strong>Paul Frolich</strong>, a left-wing journalist who survived till 1953. <em>Haymarket Books</em> republished the book in 2010 and I got that from a bookstore in <em>Buffalo</em> in 2022.</p></li><li><p>   Two books by <strong>John Reed</strong>: <strong><em>The War in Eastern Europe</em></strong>, <strong><em>Insurgent Mexico</em></strong>. I have said many times that Reed had one of the most romantic and adventurous lives I could hope for. After graduation, he lived with <strong>Pancho Villa</strong>’s men in the early years of the long <em>Mexican Revolution</em>. I am pleased every time seeing the optimism and friendliness of these revolutionists, as it is like a reinforcement of stating that a bright future is ahead. The Eastern Europe book accounts his adventures on the front in <em>Serbia, Ottoman Empire, Romania, and Russia</em> during the WWI earlier years before Bulgaria joined the war. <strong>Boardman Robinson</strong>’s sketches helped delivered the tragic of a poor yet belligerent region. Interestingly they played <em>Bridge</em> for a week when detained in a hotel by Russian military officials. Reed was a <em>Harvard</em> alumnus. (Two main way to promote <em>Bridge</em>: by <em>blood</em>, or by a <em>prestigious school</em>.)</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>Animal Farm</em></strong>. I guess it is never too late to read it.</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>二手时间</em></strong>, by <strong>Svetlana Alexievich</strong>. It is surprising to see so many real and fictious stories that look exactly the same to our people’s history and present. Sometimes it is a torment to read, as we cannot see the way out. Like those lyrics said, “want to <em>break free</em>, yet not able to face it.”</p></li><li><p>   <strong>无路可逃</strong>&amp;<strong>一百个人的十年</strong>by <strong>Feng Jicai</strong>. <em>Cultural Revolution</em> is revolution, is it? L once said that the covid years of 2020 to 2023 are exactly <em>“no place to escape.”</em> People nowadays are warning for a second CR, yet interestingly, the last one is <em>left-wing</em>, and the coming one is <em>far-right</em>. </p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>天国之秋</em></strong> by <strong>Stephen Platt</strong>. I recognized the author since reading <strong><em>湖南人与现代中国</em></strong>, one of the most inspiring reading experiences I got that helped shaped my <em>self-identity</em>. Platt’s book focused on the importance of foreign intervention and the charisma of <strong>Hong Ren-Gan</strong>. </p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>Morte Accidentale di un Anarchico</em></strong>. <em>Piazza Fontana, la luna rossa e rossa di violenza</em>. I guess I should be ready for next semester’s Italian course.</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>五四运动史</em></strong>, by <strong>Chow Tse-Tsung</strong>. A best place to look for analogies for all the unspeakable <em>student movements</em> of this country, as May the Fourth is luckily the source of <em>legitimacy</em> of almost all parties. </p></li><li><p>   About 1848: <strong><em>1848, Year of Revolution</em></strong>, by <strong>Mike Rapport</strong>, a nice introduction to the revolutions in Europe from 1848-1851. I got to know <em>Repubblica Romana</em> of 1849 for the first time, and hoped to read more romance on <strong>Mazzini</strong> and <strong>Garibaldi</strong>. Therefore, I tried <strong><em>Gadfly</em></strong>, and was disappointed. What a shame to tell this kind of story with the background of revolution. I read <strong><em>18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Civil War in France</em></strong> written by <strong>Marx</strong>. To be honest, I was not able to comprehend anything.</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>北京法源寺</em></strong> by <strong>Li Ao</strong>. Those Hunanese reformer and revolutionist are always inspiring to me. My family visited the temple later in a cold winter Saturday. Unfortunately, I could not get access to the relics the book mentioned. There was a lovely <em>black cat</em>, and a group of people attending the ritual of embracing <em>Buddhism</em>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Literature-in-general"><a href="#Literature-in-general" class="headerlink" title="Literature in general:"></a>Literature in general:</h2><ul><li><p>   <strong><em>酒吧长谈</em></strong> by <strong>Mario Llosa</strong>. A mind-blowing reading adventure. A perfectly-comprehensible <em>multi-thread</em> storytelling. I guess it could be put under Revolution category too, but it’s more about a young enthusiastic drifting away from ideals. I got the book in 2018 when I was still taking that Spanish elementary course in RDFZ, and I would practice pronouncing <em>“Conversación en La catedral”</em> every night going to bed.</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>The Master and Margarita</em></strong>. <strong>Mikhail Bulgakov</strong>. I got the book from a blind book-exchange game organized by <em>ESN</em> at <em>Language Café</em> of LUISS in April 2019. I swapped out my <strong><em>Panama Papers</em></strong> as I guessed that I may not pass our custom. I suppose not all craziness is attractive to me and I seriously know little about religion.</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>纽约客</em></strong>(白先勇). If I had read it in 2018, I promise I would get <em>sentimental</em>. </p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>海都物语</em></strong>, by <strong>塩野七生</strong>. Simply wanted to read of the history of <em>Venice Republic</em>. What a heroic history of Republican ideas in actions of <em>pragmatists</em>.</p></li><li><p>   Two books about Prussia and German Empire as a by-product of addiction to <em>Paradox Interactives</em> games. <strong><em>不含传说的普鲁士</em></strong> by <strong>Sebastian Haffner</strong>, and <strong><em>脆弱的崛起</em></strong> by <strong>徐弃郁</strong>. There’s already serious comparisons of our situation to Germany’s in pre-WWI era. Beware: please make more <em>friends</em>.</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>蛙</em></strong> by <strong>莫言</strong>. First time reading his book. How about a <em>sequel</em> of new generations?</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>Steppenwolf</em></strong> by <strong>Hermann Hesse</strong>. All I was thinking: wow the protagonist in already <em>50</em>?</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>野草 故事新篇</em></strong>. Please forgive me for not completing my high school reading requirement. I felt T made Lu-Xun an <em>icon close to God</em> in my class at that time, and I remember the serious-looking face of my jocular desk-mate when he was reading <strong><em>坟</em></strong>.</p></li><li><p>   <strong><em>与时俱进的启蒙</em></strong> by <strong>徐贲</strong>. Thankfully he is still publishing books. The materials matter less than the <em>reassurance</em> that there is still <em>light shining into my room</em>.</p></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="SPOILER-ALERT"><a href="#SPOILER-ALERT" class="headerlink" title="SPOILER ALERT"></a>SPOILER ALERT</h2><p>I watched <strong><em>Where the Crawdads Sing</em></strong> (movie) this afternoon.</p><p>A film like that is a perfect closure for all the miseries this year started in January. At the beginning of 2023 I was blocking myself out in that dark room, watching the whole 7 seasons of <strong><em>Elementary</em></strong>. Crawdads came into my attention as I was looking for <strong>Daisy Edgar-Jones</strong>’ works. Her portrait of Marianne in <strong><em>Normal People</em></strong> was quite intriguing.</p><p>It is E who first introduced me to <em>Ecofeminism</em>. The idea of connecting Women and Nature, who are both under the yoke of dominant human males, was a bit far-fetched yet fascinating due to its mystical spirituality that she loved. By that time people just started to recover from covid, when female medical workers’ contribution was under-valued. She guided me through different schools of feminism, and we were proud to explore what we could do to revoke certain groups of people’s compromised positions.</p><p>How Kya fought from a repressed youth and seek nature as her natural company delivered a perfect portrait of Ecofeminism. Stereotypically, women and nature always co-habit harmoniously, while the combination of men and nature often implies conquer. Love the words Kya said: “I don’t know if there’s a dark side to nature, just inventive ways to endure.” She endured, and she fought smartly. For a moment I was disappointed that she married that guy who abandoned her once, but then I realized perhaps I’m not in the right position to judge.</p><p>Back to <strong><em>Elementary</em></strong>. I watched its first episode countless times years ago when it piloted. An Asian female Watson was never appealing to me, and now it seems funny that a female Watson could have pure friendship yet other same-sex modern Holmes-Watson duo usually contains sexual innuendos.</p><p>After that there were some big life decisions (or shall I say delay?). I finished season 1 of <strong><em>Masters of Sex</em></strong>. Interestingly my friends usually know <strong>Michael Sheen</strong> from <strong><em>Good Omens</em></strong>, but for me he is the scum lawyer Roland Blum in <strong><em>The Good Fight</em></strong>. The stories of discovering the mechanism of orgasms and women’s fight for improving status in sexual behaviors and workplace were truly inspiring, but the series lack some drama that could push to watch on. Same happened to <strong><em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em></strong>, which I skipped the last season.</p><p>Similar topics, <strong><em>Sex Education</em></strong> is my favorite series which I finished the last season in early December. I watched the first season in astonishment while being quarantined in Leuven. What a sex Utopia it is! Gladly we had a great biology teacher who vividly taught us how to us condoms, and we should do more to educate young people how to respect our partners, ask and listen to each other’s needs and feelings, and be open to pioneer ideologies. Happily, knowledges were learnt, mistakes I had were pointed out, and some tips were even put into practice. I’m proud to quote that “we don’t restrain ourselves into biological gender roles and we explore, communicate, and respect what we like as two sexual comrades.”</p><p>I always imagine that I were the leading male character in shows I love. So, when Issac deleted Otis’ message, it marked the lowest point of my Leuven months. Anyway, I had expressed to E many times that in case of gender equality, I do believe in over-compensating the ‘repressed-side.’  I was glad to see Maeve finally decided to stay abroad and pursue her dreams while Otis was still somehow immature and stuck in his little hometown. Also, I truly resonate with Maeve’s last letter to Otis – “dear you, you cracked my heart open, you introduced me to an equal, unconventional, empathic relationship, and I will never be that bit-traditional-head young guy again, and I will carry a part of you with me wherever I go.”</p><p>Through out the year I watched a lot of <strong>Marvel</strong> productions, but all of them were extremely terrible, including <strong><em>Loki 2</em></strong>, which was quite well-received online recently. In the past years my favorite one was <strong><em>Shang-Chi</em></strong>, which has a better-than-average plot and perfect spoken mandarin. Sadly, <strong>Simu Liu</strong> looks too much like our Big Brother.</p><p>-—– midsession break ——</p><p>Honorable mentions: LC recommended two movies that we watched during summer. <strong><em>1898 Los últimos de Filipinas</em></strong>, a Spanish film about the empire’s last days holding their Philippine colonies, and <strong><em>El Norte</em></strong>, a tragic story of a Guatemalan brother-sister duo who fled their homeland for United States, where immigrant fantasy eventually was shattered.</p><p>-—– midsession break ——</p><p><strong><em>Vigil</em></strong> season 1. I kind of developed a taste for lesbian romance. I like <strong>Rose Leslie</strong>, aka Ygritte in the <strong><em>Game of Thrones</em></strong>. She already delivered an outstanding performance of <strong>Maia</strong> in the <strong><em>Good Fight</em></strong> as a lesbian lawyer. Watching submarine&#x2F;enclose space-related shows in Munger room was quite a unique experience.</p><p><strong><em>Reds</em></strong>, an American film about their most famous socialist activist and journalist John Salis “Jack” Reed, made me cry. It was produced in the 80s, thus it was still during cold war. The story focused on Reed and his partner Louise, and their adventures reporting WWI and the Russian revolution. I was still in the break-up mood that time, and the scene of Jack and Louise, comrades and lovers, holding hands in Eastern Europe prairie, against the strong winds, irritating sands and heavy snows, against all the odds, is the most ideal representation of a romantic relationship, and I feel that I once had that.</p><p>There seems be a lot about feminism. On plane to the US I watched <strong><em>Barbie</em></strong> and <strong><em>Little Women</em></strong> (2019). I believe one of the core ideas is to give confidence to people who were systematically discouraged, and to offer equal or even more opportunities. Allan, and some other details, perfectly demonstrated that people are not born women but becoming women. I myself, having been in compromised or vulnerable positions several times, either voluntarily or unwillingly, may have encountered something similar and been somehow able to sympathize. Interestingly <strong><em>Barbie</em></strong> and <strong><em>Sex Education</em></strong> share a great number of cast members. By the way, I recently had a huge crush on Irish accent and people overall. <strong>Saoirse Ronan</strong> motivated me to watch <strong><em>Little Women</em></strong>, O played by <strong>Thaddea Graham</strong>, a Northen Irish adopted Hunanese actor, has such a lovely accent, and Mark Allen the professional snooker player from Northen Ireland has the sexist voice when he is doing game commentary.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AA is warmer than I expected.</p><p>Probably because I still don’t drive, the vastitude of the American suburban looks a bit terrifying as before. I kinda felt lost standing in the drizzling breezes, trapped by the countless streams of automobiles.</p><p>I never hate this place, and I don’t even hate that windowless room. It’s just that I have “revisited” so many places before, returning to AA turns out to be a unique experience.</p><p>Every step I took, every road I walked, penny I spent, were seen in a practical sense, rather than a “oh I gotta take a picture” kinda exciting mood.</p><p>There was a little quarrel on money today. Affording studying abroad could be a piece of cake or a tremendous burden for a Chinese family, and mine is somewhat closer to the latter end. Usually I’d choose to make life as comfortable as possible and not care about trying to save a bit, but on occasions I’d quite hesitant on financial decisions. One of the biggest arguments I had with E was simply caused by my overspending at a Beijing style restaurant when we arrived in Milano during vacation. During these years I am actually the cautious and conservative type, but many times I always autonomously copy jscq’s habits.</p><p>Anyway, in the last few days of 2023, I planned to write about the movies and books I watched and read this year, and hopefully there’ll be something more serious.</p><p>F.Y.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back to AA  </p><p>I had a colleague at K, who is a PhD student in THU and has been working as an intern there for more than 3 years.<br>Interestingly, though having these years in industry, he is desperate to find a teaching job (ideally AP) in a top university. A 211+ school in or near Beijing, to be specific, as his GF is already working in Beijing.<br>I could not get his mindset, and at my final day I asked him why. Why you must be a professor, why not make more money in industry, why it must be Beijing?<br>“Have you watched Shawshank? I want to be institutionalized.”<br>I was quite shocked.<br>To me he is already the opposition to many of my ideal principles: don’t let your partner ‘limit’ your choice, choose the money job if the other is about love, choose a different place for your next journey, …etc, but at that moment his “institutionalized” words sounded really courageous to me.<br>You see? Of course I personally do not want to be institutionalized, such as doing same things every day, having the same un-evolving mindset through the years, but partly it’s because I perhaps am not ready for some more responsibility. And those unconventional and crazy thoughts of mine, are they partly serving as a run-away from some more real and imminent challenges?<br>It’s 5+ years into adulthood now. Based on those years’ interaction and observation, we seemed to have formed some quite different life styles and ideologies, but I guess lots of us are still seeking and ready to change.<br>F.Y.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Flying in 8 hours.</p><p>So, there was another conversation. “Don’t be fooled by that vulnerability ‘chicken-soup’.” It’s always about Migliorare, about being stronger, and always an independent journey since long long ago.</p><p>I left with a promise to talk about Huey Long, so here it is.</p><p>My obsession to <a href="https://kaiserreich.fandom.com/wiki/The_Kaiserreich_Wiki">Kaiserreich</a>, a HOI4 game mod, started since last year in college till this June. It came with that so-called “political depression” I had regarding the changing world. The mod provided a perfect platform where one may explore a whole spectrum of ideologies and alternate situation.</p><p>Huey Long, in particular, is one of the options, a fascinating path. To be concise, in a short 33-year life, he grew from a country boy to a respected lawyer, then politician, governor, and finally being shot as senator. Being accused of de-facto dictatorship, he greatly promoted the well-being of Louisianna, boosted education, infrastructure, and social equality. He was on the road to his dream: “every man a king”, but was sadly shot on the way.</p><p>That day when I was visiting the congress building, wandering on the streets of Baton Rouge, people all showed their pity and respect to that legendary leader. Yet the style of the magnificent tower, the authority of statues, and the quasi-insane enthusiasm once people had towards him are quite dangerous.</p><p>Long, along with Jack Reed, are the most prefunding inspirations I got from Kaiserreich. “Man, a life like that? Totally worth it.”</p><p>But why I could not find someone in the OTL that makes me feel the same way(Peng Huang, maybe)? Perhaps it’s the idea of “having a second chance in the alternate universe.” A mixed-legendary-tragic life in OTL, and a could-have-been perfect fantasy in KR, somehow compensated for the uncertainty of my unpredictable future.</p><p>There’s a lot more to talk about Long, Reed, and other KR&#x2F;political admiration I had, but those feelings faded a little in recent months, partly thanks to a busy schedule and an improving mentality. Nonetheless, I do decide to continue to read and learn from them, figuring out if there’s something I can do in this 2020s that is as full of uncertainties, turmoil, and opportunities as 100 years ago was.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Buon Natale ragazzi.</p><p>It’s been a while. Last time I wrote was 22nd Mar, when I just came back from New Orleans. I got sick at that time, coughing all the time, but not covid, I guessed. I cancelled my appointment with UHS as it was conflicted with an ‘experimental’ little trip of mine. That decision turned out to be quite wrong.</p><p>Things were not moving towards the better directions, and I was more isolated than before. The only salvation was snooker&#x2F;pool. I met some new friends and kept in touch with some old ones in the Munger basement. Watching World Championship was once a nice way to keep a healthy schedule, and Si Jiahui’s miraculous run was more than encouraging to me. However, a dream always has an end, does it?</p><p>Tears.</p><p>And darkness, and some feelings that I could not describe even now.</p><p>My family rescued me in the end, and I should be grateful to my precious friends that helped a lot.</p><p>Let me skip the details here. Being back home, moving, getting internship, almost not seeing any friends (not sure I truly wanted that). Results turned out to be satisfiable, and I’m about to restart that journey I messed up heavily.</p><p>To be honest the pressure and the fear did come back a little recently. The fact that I just had the most memorable two weeks in the past four months is not going to change it. I suppose, at the very moment of the break-up, I officially started the challenge to bring back the old me. During those years, I became overly obsessed with the idea “it’s ok to express your vulnerability” but never had grasped its true spirit. Simply put, I failed to seek out for help almost every time I needed it.</p><p>I may have put too much emotion into some recent encounters. After I failed to turn back and try to talk with the stranger wearing hoodies with Tat Ming’s lyrics on, I could not stop thinking if that was a symbol of me missing her, missing a soul mate, or missing some romantic braveness I had before.  </p><p>There’s also the experience of yesterday that I felt truly happy. I might idealize and symbolize some important old friends in some ways over the years. Keeping in contact or not, they sometimes are beacons that tell me there’s certain ways of living I may aim for, sometimes serve as reference that help reinforce some of my own preference, and sometimes are characters in dreams that I can’t explain.</p><p>I talked about bringing back my craziness, courage, and energy back yesterday in pyq, and I hoped I am on the right track now. The truth is that I don’t know. Perhaps it’s because that I had such a different week than the routine internship days, I am fearing, wondering, hesitating, and confused with mixed feelings more than ever.</p><p>My sense tells me that I am quite ready to go, and next year I should be confident to nail it. But my sensitivity and sentiments?  Boy it’s a long way to go.</p><p>F.Y.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, a bit later than planned.</p><p>It was a great trip to Louisiana, though the competition result was not that good, spending times with old partners and teammates was never boring, and the extra adventure to Baton Rouge was nice. I’ll talk about Huey Long next time.</p><p>I promised to talk about books.</p><p>A huge portion of books I read is detective novels.  When I was very young, one of the first books I read was Sherlock Holmes in Chinese. I never managed to finish all of the stories but reading it was really cool and satisfying, as, to be honest, seeming to be intelligent was real sexy.</p><p>But I did not read a lot for a long time, I could name less than ten books that moved me and were read completely by me before Gaosan. Kuerliulangji, the first book my dad bought for me; Sanguoyanyi, reading it as a by-product of obsessed with Sanguosha; Shuihuzhuan, another try to classics as Sanguo turned out well; Pingfandeshijie, kinda felt related because I was in a relationship; Langtuteng, kinda obsessed with mysteries; Sishitongtang, during the rebellious Chusan; Harry Potter, the first time I read in English seriously.</p><p>During that time, most of other readings were tedious and boring to me. The first attempt for English book by myself was The Death On the Nile I bought at an airport. Sadly there was a reading report I had to hand in as the winter vacation homework so I read the plot summary on Wikipedia and ended up only reading 50% of the book.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was a great book. By that time I was still having trouble remembering the characters’ names of any foreign book. Also, I have an obsession of reading the ‘big names’. I guess it was the part of the education I received. ‘Always read the classics’. I kept looking for the most famous detective novelists, some ‘top 100’ books lists, and bought all of them to satisfy both my greed for intriguing plots and my pride.</p><p>Agatha Christie is the biggest part of the list, then John Dickson Carr, Ellery Queen (still waiting to read the tragedies trilogy). Other writer I would only read few so-called ‘best’ ones, like Raymond Chandler, Lawrence Block, Josephine Tey, etc. I guess I only care for the classics part of the detective novels, mostly from US and UK. I know nowadays Japanese novels are dispensable in detective novels market, but I never bothered to check any of them, as I only tried a book from their pioneer Edogawa Rampo.</p><p>The best detective novels I read in Chinese is 1367 by the Hong Kong man Chen Haoji. The time I enjoyed reading it coincided with the political movements happening in HK in 2019. Combining those politics, colonization, duty, police, self-identification, revolution (1967) topics really intrigued me.</p><p>Well, I am a bit sick back from travelling, that’s all for today.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last several days were the most eventful I have experienced since a long time.</p><p>I had the honor to have my two great friends visiting in a short notice. The laughter with them is always satisfying and comforting.</p><p>There was a karaoke, although not as perfect as I pictured. It was surprising to me that some feelings never came out, and I barely have tears to remember my old time again, only some soft songs while closing my eyes, feeling the sympathy around I believe that my friends were showing.</p><p>Happily, one of them embarked into a brand-new relationship. Many were forgotten. I got the feeling that, like me, his story is about being alone and loneliness.</p><p>Again, I knew I’m cared and loved, in ways that I hardly noticed and had to look closely for. Some stuttering and little lies included, the process is always about making things better.</p><p>I became better and better in pool game. Games seem essential to me. Winning or losing a particular game is exciting and reassuring. Life is a game that is so complicated, the uncertainty and ambiguity make me lost in confusion.</p><p>I am still a bit worried about how should I talk about my situation to others, friends, acquaintance, or even strangers. There is also a serious familial and financial issue that I must attack asap.</p><p>Above, that’s some random mumbling. I promise to talk about books and movies next time and write something in depth.</p><p>F.Y.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last, I’d say, 100 days, are a somehow weird and tough period of my life.</p><p>Not being sure what was the trigger, I went through a long time of being lost and depressed. As for the outcome, I decided to live a special semester, and I just broke up.</p><p>I could be seen as a gesture of cutting the old life behind. The relationship lasted about three years and three months, which includes most of my undergraduate life in Europe, and then here, and it was almost all her whole college life.</p><p>Last night Munger was out of wireless internet, so I was lying on bed going through the pictures on my phone. Glorious days, indeed, though somehow attributed to those beautiful and mind-freshening views of Italia.</p><p>We had a close relationship, and we both had a rather petite life circle due to covid and our personalities. What I wanted to say, is , that during those years together and apart, our passions and likes were developing and changing.</p><p>I had no interest Kaiserreich, Habsburg, European history in general before I left Italy. I couldn’t care less when I saw some Spanish-related institutes in Leuven. I only started regretting not seeing enough European cities while I have been in state for a few months.</p><p>I have no certain plan right now. Make sure my status is ok, read all the books I currently have, play some good bridge, travel a bit, and cure, try figure thing with my family.</p><p>And this, is the extra plan. I want to write.</p><p>It’d be like the songs I wrote about on WeChat before. Maybe a few time a week, I’d try let some stories happen to me everyday and write them down. And there are lots of books I am reading worth putting my thought into solid words rather than some fantasies that both intrigue and bother me ever since growing up.</p><p>So, I’d start on some of my new stories, hope they will be coming soon.</p><p>Buona Giornata.</p><p>Fred.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>When I was writing my application letters for graduate school yesterday, I found this “Personal Statement” I wrote for HKU application three years ago. It was a week after Gaokao, and I could estimate that my score would not be good enough, so I wrote this PS casually but devotedly. It is a story about Beijing and Changsha, about my identity, and it’s still worth reading.</em></p><p>Personal Statement</p><p>Who am I</p><p>June 8th, 2018, after finishing Gaokao, I took the late flight from Changsha to Beijing to reunite with my schoolmates and take graduation photograph. This trip was hard to define. Was it a trip BACK home? Or did I just fly TO Beijing? Logically speaking, I live in Beijing, so it is my home. Geographically and emotionally speaking , my hometown is Changsha, the place where I was born. So, whenever a university asked me where I come from, I would hesitate, then answer “maybe Beijing” and think that perhaps anywhere would be my home.</p><p>In Beijing, I am proud to be a Hunanese. Though my identity set difficulties for me to attend high school in Beijing and disallowed me to take Gaokao in Beijing, I am not embarrassed with this situation. I embraced my education and expressed my talents. I luckily attend a great primary school by my parents’ efforts; I was chosen in the Early Development Program of RDFZ for talented students; I performed well in Zhongkao and successfully continued my education in high school. In my life, there is a voice that keeps telling me to inherit the Four Spirit of Changsha people, which are perseverance, bravery, patience, and optimism. I carried these spirits to stand out in my circle and carried these spirits to get on well with things around me, proving that I am strong enough to survive in Beijing.</p><p>I miss my hometown in Beijing, missing the food, the accents, the weather, everything. However, when I went back to Changsha to take Gaokao, I found that I got lost in my hometown. My new classmates treated me more as a Beijinger than a local fellow, and they were surprised to hear dialectical words and Hunanese accent from my speaking. At that time, I was a little bit disappointed, since it seemed that I was not fully accepted by neither Beijing nor Changsha.</p><p>Confused, I began to think that whether the environment accepts me is not a major problem, as the real question is that what I accept myself as. Fortunately, the experience in Changsha in last few months provided me a great chance to rethink my path. Being far away from Beijing, still not familiar with new friends and classmates, I got a better condition to observe things around me.</p><p>Honestly, what I received in Beijing, in RDFZ, is a quite liberal education that allowed me to pursue what I am interested in with the smallest limit. I met baseball, I found Bridge, and I was even allowed to climb up to the dangerous roof of school building to make movie. By contrast, in Changsha, the administration on students is believed to be stricter. However, I am not saying that one condition is better than the other. I encountered the authentic spirits during my stay in Changsha. The spirits were not just in Hunanese’s mind. They put them into action: the dedication in study, the ambition to leave Hunan, represent Hunan, and make contribution to our country as a Hunanese.</p><p>I came to a conclusion that why I felt strange in both two cities is that maybe I have qualities from both cities. That conclusion excites me and encourages me to continue my life path with my treasured experience and spirits.</p><p>Now I am standing on the crossroads to universities. I always believe a new place would be a great choice. Hong Kong is the metropolitan that attracts me. I have been there for countless times for SAT exams, for Bridge competitions, and for holiday trips. I even founded a Cantonese Culture Club in high school two years ago. Hong Kong has a more liberal environment, a warm and humid climate of southern China, an intricate metro system, and a diverse language environment mixing Cantonese, Mandarin and English that I longed for.</p><p>All in all, I believe that wherever I go, I will keep my pride as a Hunanese, and more importantly, as a person who treats everywhere as his home.   </p><p>First written on 15&#x2F;06&#x2F;2018, Beijing.</p><p>Edited on 31&#x2F;01&#x2F;2021, Roma</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/fabio-e1555411932808.jpg"></p><p>Fabio Carli</p><p>“Queen’s Road East”(皇后大道东): 1991,<br>the most famous Cantonese song about the handover of Hong Kong, describes the<br>worries, excitement, hesitation, and expectation of local people in humorous lyrics.<br>‘My dear friends, bidding goodbye, left this metropolis and went afar, and now<br>we gonna depend on the great comrades to cook up some new ideas.’</p><p>“Pear of the Orient”(东方之珠):<br>1991, the Iconic song celebrating the handover of Hong Kong, is a chant for the<br>city’s unrest past and prosperous future. ‘For five thousand years, the sea<br>wind blows. Please remember my face, forever yellow.’</p><p>“Old Friend Seems To Be<br>Coming”(似是故人来): 1992, one of the best song of the ‘pop queen’ Anita Mui(梅艳芳).</p><p>……</p><p>All these unforgettable songs, which marked the peak of Hong Kong pop music and witnessed the legendary 1990s of China, are arranged by an Italian musician: Fabio Carli.</p><p>Fabio Carli was born in<br>Ronchi dei Legionari, Italy, in 1951. He founded a band called ‘I Cobra’ and<br>went on tour in Europe by covering some successful works of Lucio Battisti<br>and New Trolls. Then he started travelling around the world. He went to<br>Dubai, Taipei, Tokyo, Sydney, and finally interestingly, spent his most<br>important 11 years in Hong Kong (1986-1997).</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/e7bd97e5a4a7e4bd91.jpg"></p><p>Fabio and 罗大佑, via sina.com</p><p>One year after Fabio’s<br>arrival, Lo Da-Yu(罗大佑) ended his 2-year stay in U.S. and decided to continue his music<br>career in Hong Kong. The two “foreigners” hit it off in the metropolis. Their<br>first song is “Rebirth”(轮回) in 1989. Lo composed, and<br>Fabio arranged. Lo said: “We were both ‘outsiders’, so we dared to challenge the<br>local traditions and taboos. We played music together in HK, the city where<br>East meets West, Left meets Right.”  </p><p>In 1990, Lo founded Music<br>Factory, which is a milestone in Chinese music history. In the Factory, Lo, who<br>composed, Fabio, who arranged, and Albert Leung(林夕), who<br>wrote lyrics, created countless Cantonese and Mandarin songs that are praised<br>as the best of all times.</p><p>“花比傲”, Fabio’s<br>Chinese name was given by Leung at the same time. The name’s Cantonese pronunciation<br>(Faa-bei-ngou) is very close to the original, and it comes from Chinese poems which<br>means “flower and pride”, so romantic.</p><p>Leung describe Fabio as a<br>man who not only “loves Chinese culture, and can create music with Chinese<br>style”, but also “can treat Chinese elements from a critical and innovative<br>point of view”, which makes their works seem “less traditional and more<br>energetic”.</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/e69e97e5a495.jpg"></p><p>Fabio and 林夕, via sina.com</p><p>Lo left HK in 1995, and<br>afterwards Fabio bid his goodbye to HK in 1997. He became a photographer and director<br>in New York and even won some awards. He went back to Italy and died of cancer<br>on April 15th, 2013, 6 years ago.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Forward: This article is about my journey to Castiglione della Pescaia and why I like Italo Calvino. I wrote in English since I hope more people can read it. All the pictures used in the article are copyright of myself. If there is any grammar mistake or cultural and semantic confusion, please feel free to point it out.</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/img_20181001_194847-1.jpg"></p><p>A copy of Il Barone Rampante, photoed by yfq32</p><p>Italo Calvino is my favorite foreign writer. (and I will tell you why later) Therefore, this winter vacation in Italy, my very first thing to do is visiting him. Having been searching information online, I figured out that there is no museum or memorial place for him. Thanks to “Italo Calvino in China”, “Find a Grave”, and a local tourist website, I got to know where his cemetery lies——Castiglione della Pescaia, right on the coast where Mr. Palomar watched and meditated the waves of the sea.</p><p>Without anything found in detail, I set the address (Cimitero di Castiglione della Pescaia) on Google Map and hit the road.</p><p>On 21st Dec 2018, I took train at 6:57 AM from Roma Termini to Grosseto. The train took around and 1.5 hour and later at 9:30, I got on the extraurbana bus to Castiglione della Pescaia.</p><p>That day had the bluest sky. I, the only passenger on the bus, along with the friendly driver, was free to enjoy the endless grassland and Mediterranean pine trees beside the road. Staring at these trees with wide branches reached to the other, I suddenly realized what Cosimo Piovasco di Rondò did may not be so difficult.</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/img_20181221_101154.jpg"></p><p>On the road, by yfq32</p><p>After bus, I still had a mile to go. I walked on the ancient roads, passed the lovely bars, and through a castle. The public cemetery is located on the mountainside, with a great view of the town on the east side and the sea on the west side. Only few people were there, and I crept silently around looking for where Italo Calvino is.</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/img_20181221_102839.jpg"></p><p>On the mountainside, by yfq32</p><p>Finally, a staff approached to me. He seemed confused to see a Chinese face in an Italian cemetery, but when I told him who I was looking for, he led me to the tombstone excitingly.</p><p>Maybe I am one of the first Chinese readers ever come here. The tomb looked the same as the picture I found online, only without the bush around it. Calvino’s wife, Esther Judith Singer, was on the left side with him. There were branches and stones placed on it, and a slight layer of dust. The mountains, sky, sea, birds, and the ticking of water drops in the cemetery, created a great harmony of nature.</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/img_20181221_104201.jpg"></p><p>Calvino and Singer, by yfq32</p><p>I silently expressed my respect and admiration, placed a bottle cap and a diamond-shape stone which represent my nickname, and left.</p><p>I spent some time pacing on the beach. After people-watching and a so-called meditation, I went back.</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/img_20181221_105053.jpg"></p><p>by yfq32</p><p>At 10th grade in high school, my friend and I found a secret ladder tube to the roof of the senior building. We enjoyed climbing through it in day and night, exploring the secret of the top of the building, chatting, and laughing. We even came there on a freezing rainy night, just standing and watching the skyscrapers in the distance and the people under our feet, or on a snowy winter day, just playing snowball and yelling. I was sort of addicted to that kind of experience and began to spend lots of time exploring other roofs in my school campus. I call these roofs the “sacred land” for my friend and I. The land for adventures, for temporary escape from the reality, for recalling the past, for meditation, for sincere conversation, for people-watching from a different point of view, for sitting in daze and daydreaming.</p><p>I regard what I did as a “run-away” of an individual. It can be simply seen as a rebellious act, or maybe there is some symbolic and metaphysical meaning behind. I made a documentary movie called “The Sacred Land” and entered my last year of high school.</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/%E5%9C%A3%E5%9C%B0%E5%89%A7%E7%85%A7%E6%88%91%E6%8B%8D.jpg"></p><p>yfq32 on the top, by YJY</p><p>The 12th grade was when I came across to Calvino’s books. At that time, I was curious to look for some famous contemporary and modern Italian writers. I got “if on a winter night a traveler” in bookstore and began reading “our ancestors” trilogy later.</p><p>I was shocked to encounter the story of Cosimo in “Baron in the trees”. “That’s me!”. My adventure on the roofs was the modern version of Cosimo’s, though I still live on ground and can’t move from a roof to another freely. However, I realized, in some metropolis where skyscrapers are everywhere and linked with overpasses, some people do live a life without touching the ground and forever in the buildings. Their lives could be more physically enriched than Cosimo’s since the modern technology ensures a safer, more convenient, and comfortable environment than in trees, but the interest of leaving your group life and living your life with your human fellows as whole from a perfect distance is the key, to which I believe I experienced thing similar.</p><p>Later, I went to another school in south, where trees were denser and greener. I got a great chance to study my previous and recent school lives from a perfect distance. Cosimo’s life can be regard as a process from individual to integrity, and I tried to do the same on me and my surroundings. Anyway, I keep looking for the similarity and difference between me and Cosimo and adding more quotes to our lives.</p><p><img src="https://yfq32.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/img_20180420_181946999999999.jpg"></p><p>Trees in my school, by yfq32</p><p>I have read almost all Calvino’s works in Chinese and English translation, and I am learning Italian to enjoy the original ones. He is not only a great writer to me, he share his thought with me. He has many great works in different styles and today is not the time for me to discuss further. Now, allow me to use his words in “Il Barone Rampante” to remember Italo Calvino: Visse sugli alberi - Amò sempre la terra - Salì in cielo.</p><p>2019.01.11 by 元芳 yfq32</p>]]></content>
